# Kanvas

Plan, track, and coordinate projects between humans and AI agents on an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Canvas board.

## Why This Exists

AI agents work best in their CLI sandboxes — that's what companies optimize their RL training for. But you still need to **plan the project**, break it into tasks, see what depends on what, and track progress as you and your agents work through it.

Kanvas gives you a visual project board in Obsidian Canvas where you lay out the plan, and agents interact with it through a CLI tool.

**The goals:**
- **Simple.** No accounts, no SaaS, no build step. It's literally just a prompt, a python CLI tool for the agents and a json file for the canvas. Clone, run `init`, start planning. The whole system is a workflow convention on top of tools you already have.
- **Both sides contribute.** You add tasks, set priorities, draw dependencies. Agents propose tasks, do work, report back. The board is a shared space, not a one-way instruction sheet.
- **Agent-agnostic.** Works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, or anything that can run a shell command. Switch agents mid-project, use multiple at once — the board doesn't care.
- **Git-friendly.** `.canvas` files are JSON. They diff, merge, and version like any other file in your repo.
- **Flexible.** Some tasks are for agents, some are for you (hardware, design, manual testing). Same board, same colors, same flow. Use one agent or five, swap them mid-project, or do everything yourself — the board adapts to how you work, not the other way around.

Obsidian Canvas already gives you cards, groups, arrows, and colors. Kanvas adds a workflow on top: color-coded task states, dependency tracking, and a CLI that keeps agents from breaking the rules.

### What's in this project

1. **The workflow prompt** (`RULES.md`) — the core. Defines task states, dependencies, and what agents can and cannot do. Copy the agent instructions (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) into your project and any LLM can follow it.

2. **The CLI tool** (`canvas-tool.py`) — keeps agents honest. Enforces valid transitions, dependency checks, and blocked states instead of letting agents edit `.canvas` JSON directly. Python 3.7+, zero dependencies.

3. **The Canvas Watcher plugin** (optional) — lints the board when *you* edit it in Obsidian. Auto-manages blocked states, catches circular deps, flags warnings. Not required.

## How It Works

Cards have colors. Colors are states. Arrows are dependencies.

| Color  | State | Who moves it |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 🟣 Purple | Proposed | Agent |
| 🔴 Red | To Do | Human |
| 🟠 Orange | Doing | Agent or Human |
| 🔵 Cyan | Review | Agent |
| 🟢 Green | Done | Human |
| ⬜ Gray | Blocked | Automatic |

```
Propose → Purple → Approve → Red → Start → Orange → Finish → Cyan → Verify → Green
```

If a task depends on something that isn't green yet, it's gray (blocked). When the dependency is done, it flips to red automatically.

## Getting Started

**Requirements:** Python 3.7+, Obsidian, Git. Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Optional:** Node.js — only needed if you want to run the standalone `canvas-watcher.js`. Not required for the CLI tool or the Obsidian plugin (which `init` installs with Python).

### Setup

Clone Kanvas **outside** your project — it's a separate tool, not something you nest inside your repo:

```bash
# Example: both repos live side by side
~/repos/Kanvas/          # ← clone Kanvas here
~/repos/my-project/      # ← your actual project
```

Then open your project folder in Obsidian (so it creates the `.obsidian/` directory), and run `init` pointing at your project:

```bash
python ~/repos/Kanvas/canvas-tool.py init ~/repos/my-project
```

This copies everything you need into the target directory:
- `canvas-tool.py` — the CLI tool
- `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` — agent instructions
- `RULES.md` — workflow protocol
- `Project.canvas` — blank board template (only if no `.canvas` file exists yet)
- **Canvas Watcher plugin** — automatically installed if `.obsidian/` exists

To skip the plugin install, pass `--no-plugin`:

```bash
python Kanvas/canvas-tool.py init /path/to/your-project --no-plugin
```

> **Note:** The Canvas Watcher plugin can only be installed if `.obsidian/` exists in your project — and that directory is created when Obsidian first opens the folder as a vault. If you run `init` before opening Obsidian, the plugin step will be skipped. Just open the folder in Obsidian and run `init` again to finish the install.

#### Manual setup

Alternatively, drop these files into your project repo yourself:

1. **`canvas-tool.py`** — the CLI tool
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** / **`AGENTS.md`** — agent instructions (pick one for your platform)
3. **A `.canvas` file** — copy `examples/blank.canvas` as a starting point, or `examples/sample-project.canvas` to see a full example

| Platform | Instruction file |
|----------|---------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` in project root |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` in project root |
| Gemini CLI | `AGENTS.md` renamed to `GEMINI.md` |
| Others | Paste `AGENTS.md` content into your agent's system prompt |

### Recommended workflow

1. **Plan first.** Open the `.canvas` in Obsidian. Add tasks yourself, or ask your agent to interview you about the project and propose a plan using `batch`. Spend time here — a good plan saves time later.

2. **Review the board.** Approve proposals (purple → red), rearrange, add dependencies by drawing arrows. Get the canvas looking right before you start executing.

3. **Execute with your agent.** The agent picks a red task, works on it, marks it for review. You verify and mark it green.

4. **Commit per task.** After each task is done, commit the code *and* the `.canvas` file together. Your git history mirrors the project plan — you can check out any commit and see the board state at that point.

5. **Repeat.** As tasks complete, blocked ones unlock. The board evolves as the project progresses.

## CLI Reference

```
python canvas-tool.py init [TARGET_DIR] [--no-plugin] # set up Kanvas in a project
python canvas-tool.py "<file>.canvas" <command> [args]
```

**Setup:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `init [DIR] [--no-plugin]` | Initialize Kanvas in a directory (copies files, optionally installs plugin) |

**Read:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `status` | Board overview |
| `show <ID>` | Task detail with dependencies |
| `list [STATE\|GROUP]` | Filter by state or group |
| `ready` | Red tasks with all deps met |
| `blocked` | Gray tasks and what blocks them |
| `blocking` | Tasks that block others |
| `dump` | Raw JSON |

**Work:**

| Command | Transition |
|---------|-----------|
| `start <ID>` | Red → Orange |
| `finish <ID>` | Orange → Cyan |
| `pause <ID>` | Orange → Red |
| `edit <ID> "<text>"` | Update description (orange only) |

**Add:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `propose <GROUP> "<TITLE>" "<DESC>" [--depends-on ID ...]` | New task (purple) |
| `propose-group "<LABEL>"` | New group |
| `batch` | Bulk-add from JSON on stdin |
| `add-dep <FROM> <TO>` | New dependency edge |
| `normalize` | Assign IDs, fix blocked states |

No delete, no done, no raw JSON editing — by design.

## Optional: Canvas Watcher Plugin

Lints the board when you edit it in Obsidian. Updates blocked states, catches circular deps, flags warnings on save. Not required — the CLI handles the agent side independently.

The plugin is installed automatically by `init` (no extra dependencies). To install manually:

```bash
node canvas-watcher-plugin/install.js    # requires Node.js
# then enable in Settings → Community plugins → Canvas Watcher
```

Or run standalone (requires Node.js): `node canvas-watcher.js` (watch mode) or `node canvas-watcher.js "Project.canvas"` (one-shot).

### Auto-layout

The plugin adds two layout buttons to the Obsidian canvas toolbar:

- **Vertical layout** (lines + down arrow) — arrange cards top-to-bottom by dependency depth
- **Horizontal layout** (lines + right arrow) — arrange cards left-to-right by dependency depth

A **layer-gap slider** below the buttons controls the spacing between dependency levels. Drag up to decrease spacing, drag down to increase it.

## Factory Extension (experimental)

This fork also includes an early multi-agent software-factory extension under:

- `docs/factory/`
- `factory-tool.py`
- `factory/`

The goal is to keep Kanvas as the visual workflow base while adding richer states, Markdown ticket files, and a supervisor/orchestrator layer.
